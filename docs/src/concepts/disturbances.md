# Disturbances

## Cyclones

At each timestep, a (potentially distinct) cyclone mortality rate is applied to each location and functional group. Each cyclone mortality scenario is defined as a series of cyclone mortality rates for each timestep, location and functional group. They are the result of applying a set of cyclone category projections generated by ReefMod [1] for each location and timestep, converted to windspeed [2], to a regression that provides a coral mortality rate as a function of windspeed. The three regression models we use (for massives, branching corals deeper than 5 meters and branching corals shallower than 5 meters) come from a data set extract from [3].
