# Inputs and Outputs

ADRIA seeks to use [Data Packages](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/#what%E2%80%99s-a-data-package) to define
a standard structure, format, and naming convention for its inputs and outputs. By definition, a Data Package
is a directory holding the required data for ADRIA to run, or results from model runs.

Data specifications are outlined/stored in this repository: https://github.com/open-AIMS/ADRIA-data-specs

The overall structure and data formats of the data packages are illustrated in the diagram below.

## Domain data package

Prior to running the ADRIA coral ecosystem model, the first step (after importing the package) is to load domain data.

```julia
dom = ADRIA.load_domain("path to some domain")
```

As the naming suggests, inputs are taken to represent a given spatial area, and so are referred to as a `Domain`.

The `Domain` data package consists of:

- Connectivity (CSVs, grouped by year)
- Degree-Heating Week trajectories (in netCDF format; dimensions: timestep ⋅ location ⋅ projection)
- Wave stress (as netCDFs; dimensions: timestep ⋅ location ⋅ projection)
- Geospatial data
- a `datapackage.json` file with machine-readable metadata
- a `README.md` file with human-readable content

Geospatial data consists of:
- polygons defining individual reefs/sites in [geopackage format](https://www.geopackage.org/)
- initial coral cover (as a netCDF; with dimensions: species/sizes ⋅ locations)

### ReefMod Datasets

Datasets from containing inputs and outputs from ReefMod can be loaded for use with
ADRIAmod. ADRIAmod requires geospatial data in [geopackage format](https://www.geopackage.org/)
, a csv file containing location ids and reef connectivity data in addition to ReefMod Data.

```julia
dom = ADRIA.load_domain(ReefModDomain, "path to ReefMod dataset", "45")
```

The expected directory structure is

```julia
ReefModDomain
│   # ReefMod Data
│   ReefMod_RCP19.nc
│   ReefMod_RCP26.nc
│   ReefMod_RCP45.nc
│   ReefMod_RCP70.nc
│   ReefMod_RCP85.nc
│

│       id_list_2023_03_30.csv 
│
└───region # geospatial data
        reefmod_gbr.gpkg 
```

### ReefMod Engine datasets

Datasets intended for use with the ReefMod Engine (RME) can also be loaded for use with ADRIAmod.
The RME represents larger spatial scales typically covering the entire Great Barrier Reef.

```julia
dom = ADRIA.load_domain(RMEDomain, "path to ReefMod Engine dataset", "45")
```

### Naming conventions

By convention, the directory name is typically the name of the reef or reef cluster.
Where multiple datasets for the same spatial domain are expected, appending a unique suffix is
recommended, such as the date of creation, such as "Moore\_2022-11-17".

The geopackage is expected to have the same filename as its Domain. For example, if
the domain name is "Example\_domain", then the geopackage file should be named
"Example\_domain.gpkg".

Degree-heating Week datasets must follow the convention of: `dhwRCP[NN].nc`

Here, `[NN]` is to be replaced with the two digit RCP code that indicates which RCP scenario
is represented by the given data cube. The following are examples of valid/expected filenames:

- `dhwRCP26.nc`
- `dhwRCP34.nc`
- `dhwRCP45.nc`
- `dhwRCP60.nc`
- `dhwRCP70.nc`
- `dhwRCP85.nc`

Similarly, below are examples of valid/expected wave stress filenames:

- `wave_RCP26.nc`
- `wave_RCP34.nc`
- `wave_RCP45.nc`
- `wave_RCP60.nc`
- `wave_RCP70.nc`
- `wave_RCP85.nc`

Below is a diagram indicating the directory layout

```

## ResultSets

The directory holding results is also treated as a data package referred to as a `ResultSet`.
Scenario outcomes are written out to disk as they complete to a directory located in the
user-defined `Output` directory (see [Getting started](@ref)).

The directory name follows the convention of `[Domain Name]__[IDs of RCPs]__[date/time of run]`.
For example: `Moore_2022-11-17__RCPs45_60__2023-01-01_19_00_00_000`

The above example `ResultSet` indicates the "Moore_2022-11-17" Domain was run for RCPs 4.5 and 6.0
at precisely 7pm (i.e., 19:00:00.000, where the trailing "000" indicates milliseconds). Note that
each "portion" of information is separated by a double underscore (`__`).

Simulation results are stored in [Zarr format](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/v2.html).
A `ResultSet` also holds a copy of:

- the scenario specifications
- the geospatial data used
- Summary statistics for the DHW/wave scenarios run, and
- Logs indicating which locations were intervened on

Below is a diagram of the directory structure. Filenames are not shown here as there may
be hundreds/thousands depending on the scenario set run.
