# The first column is reef ID and must correspond to the RME list of
# reef IDs in the id_list.csv file.
# Each row is a reef and each column is different initial scenario defined
# in conjunction with the same column in the other intial cover files.
# The vales are cover as a percentage.
# In each run repeat of the RME a random column is chosen for the start
# conditions and the same column is used in all the initial cover files.
