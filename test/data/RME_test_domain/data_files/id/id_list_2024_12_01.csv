# reef_id
# The reef IDs here are the standard used throughout the RME and
# must be the same as in all the other data files used.
# If reef IDs do not match up across files the RME will not run.
# The order here is also important since this must match the
# connectivity matrix files that do not have reef IDs embedded.
# Note that some alternate lists of reef IDs are circulating
# that have five reefs renamed as follows:
# used in RME   alternate
# 10-441        11-325
# 11-288        11-244e
# 11-303        11-244f
# 11-310        11-244g
# 11-311        11-244h
# These are just renamings as can be seen on a map of GBR.
# 10-441 is between two groups with IDs 10-44x and 11-32x,
# alternate ID 11-325 just makes it part of the other group.
# Alternate IDs 11-244e,f,g,h brings four unnamed reefs into
# "Great Detatched Reef" group which they are clearly part of.
# The alternate IDs are likely a newer revision, but currently
# the RME uses the orignal (legacy) reef IDs.
# Additionally a error has been propagated through many files
# where the reef id listed here as "20-198" is listed as "20198".
# Note the RME is case-insensitive to letters in the reef IDs.
# They can be upper or lower case when specified, when reported
# they are upper-case.

# area_km2
# The area of the reef in square kilometres.

# sand_proportion
# Proportion of reef which is non-grazable (sand)
# as a proportion (range 0 to 1).

# shelf_position
# The location of the reef on the continental shelf:
# 1 = inshore
# 2 = midshelf
# 3 = offshore

# cots_cull_sites
# The number of cull sites for the cots control algorithm
