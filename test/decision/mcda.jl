@testset "Validate included MCDA methods" begin
    """
    Identifies MCDA methods that pass a simple test to inform whether they should be included
    in ADRIA.

    - A [10 â‹… 5] decision matrix is set up (10 alternates, 5 criteria).
    - Only criteria 2 and 3 are considered, where Criteria 3 is given maximum weight.
      The others are given weights of zero.
    - The desired ranks 10 to 1 based on the values for Criteria 3
    - The desired ranks should be flipped when the directionality of optimization is reversed
      (e.g., minimize to maximize)
    - Each method is tested to ensure the known ranks are produced in both directions.

    MCDA methods that are included for use with ADRIA are those that pass the above.

    This validation accepts methods that were shown to produce nonsensical results
    when considering only a single criterion, but in practice such cases should not
    eventuate (see notes below).

    Notes:
        The MooraMethod only works if there are combinations of min and max directions.

    Listed below are methods which failed a separate simple test where only heat stress (DHW)
    is considered and the method selected the hottest locations (marked with "**")
    or produced a nonsensical selection (e.g., ranks following location order such as
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5; marked with "*^").

        - ** JMcDM.Topsis.TopsisMethod,
        - ** JMcDM.ARAS.ArasMethod,
        - *^ JMcDM.COCOSO.CocosoMethod,
        - ** JMcDM.CODAS.CodasMethod,
        - ** JMcDM.EDAS.EdasMethod,
        - ** JMcDM.GREY.GreyMethod,
        - ** JMcDM.MABAC.MabacMethod,
        - ** JMcDM.MARCOS.MarcosMethod,
        - *^ JMcDM.MOORA.MooraMethod,
        - ** JMcDM.SAW.SawMethod,
        - ** JMcDM.WASPAS.WaspasMethod,
        - ** JMcDM.WPM.WPMMethod

    Current identified methods (as of 2024-03-17) are:

    - CoCoSo
    - Mairca
    - Moora
    - PIV
    - VIKOR

    The PSI method passes the simple test based on heat stress mentioned above, but does not
    pass the assessment applied in this test.

    Moora and CoCoSo also fail the heat stress test but is included based on the assessment
    here as the conditions in which only a single criteria is examined should not occur in
    practice.
