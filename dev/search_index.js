A key criticism by Puy et al. was that the PAWN method is sensitive to its tuning parameters and thus may produce biased results. The tuning parameters referred to are the number of samples (N) and the number of conditioning points - n in Puy et al., but denoted as S here.\n\nPuy et al., found that the ratio of N (number of samples) to S has to be sufficiently high (NS  80) to avoid biased results. Pianosi and Wagener point out this requirement is not particularly difficult to meet. Using the recommended value (S = 10), a sample of 1024 runs (small for purposes of Global Sensitivity Analysis) meets this requirement (102410 = 1024). Additionally, lower values of NS is more an indication of faulty experimental design moreso than any deficiency of the PAWN method.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"API/#ADRIA.sensitivity.rsa-Union{Tuple{T}, Tuple{DataFrames.DataFrame, AbstractVector{T}, DataFrames.DataFrame}} where T<:Real","page":"ADRIA API","title":"ADRIA.sensitivity.rsa","text":"rsa(X::DataFrame, y::AbstractVector{<:Real}, model_spec::DataFrame; S::Int64=10)::Dataset\nrsa(r_s::YAXArray, X_q::AbstractArray, X_i::AbstractArray, y::AbstractVecOrMat{<:Real}, sel::BitVector)::YAXArray\nrsa(X::Vector{Float64}, y::AbstractVector{<:Real}, foi_spec::DataFrame; S::Int64=10)::YAXArray\nrsa(rs::ResultSet, y::AbstractVector{T}; S::Int64=10)::Dataset where {T<:Real}\nrsa(rs::ResultSet, y::AbstractVector{T}, factors::Vector{Symbol}; S::Int64=10)::Dataset where {T<:Real}\nrsa(rs::ResultSet, y::AbstractVector{T}, factor::Symbol; S::Int64=10)::YAXArray where {T<:Real}\n\nPerform Regional Sensitivity Analysis.\n\nRegional Sensitivity Analysis is a Monte Carlo Filtering approach which aims to identify which (group of) factors drive model outputs within or outside of a specified bound. Outputs which fall inside the bounds are regarded as \"behavioral\", whereas those outside are \"non-behavioral\". The distribution of behavioral/non-behavioral subsets are compared for each factor. If the subsets are not similar, then the factor is influential. The sensitivity index is simply the maximum distance between the two distributions, with larger values indicating greater sensitivity.\n\nThe implemented approach slices factor space into S bins and iteratively assesses behavioral (samples within the bin) and non-behavioral (out of bin samples) subsets with the non-parametric k-sample Anderson-Darling test. Larger values indicate greater dissimilarity (thus, sensitivity). The Anderson-Darling test places more weight on the tails compared to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\n\nRSA can indicate where in factor space model sensitivities may be, and contributes to a Value-of-Information (VoI) analysis.\n\nIncreasing the value of S increases the granularity of the analysis, but necessitates larger sample sizes.\n\nNote: Values of type missing indicate a lack of samples in the region.\n\nArguments\n\nrs : ResultSet\nX : scenario specification\ny : scenario outcomes\nmodel_spec : Model specification, as extracted by ADRIA.model_spec(domain) or from a ResultSet\nfactors : Specific model factors to examine\nS : number of bins to slice factor space into (default: 10)\n\nReturns\n\nDataset\n\nExamples\n\nADRIA.sensitivity.rsa(X, y; S=10)\n\nReferences\n\nPianosi, F., K.
