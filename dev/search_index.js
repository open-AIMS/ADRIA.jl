Continued climate change has scope to erode reef biodiversity, key ecosystem functions, and the ecosystem services they provide for people.

For investors, ADRIA helps analysts identify which options (R&D and/or deployment solutions) might have the highest likelihood of providing ecological and social returns on investment across a range of considered environmental conditions. While ADRIA’s key function is as a decision-support tool for intervention deployment, it uses a simple proxy model for reef coral dynamics, consisting of vital rates parameterised in a set of linked differential equations for four coral groups. The growth, mortality and recruitment of those four coral groups are further parameterised by environmental drivers and by different restoration and adaptation interventions.","category":"page"},{"location":"synopsis/","page":"Synopsis","title":"Synopsis","text":"The primary purpose of ADRIA is to help guide intervention deployment such that net benefits are maximised against primary objectives and minimised against costs.

It is a deterministic low-discrepancy quasi-monte carlo sampler. Samples are described as having low discrepancy if the samples are equi-distributed, and thus guarantee an even exploration of parameter space. One limitation of the Sobol' method is that  all factors are assumed to be independent. For most factors represented in ADRIA, this assumption holds true. Specific factors relating to intervention options may conditionally co-vary however, and this dependency is introduced by adjusting the sample values a posteriori to restrict sampled values to their plausible  combinations, and to map continuous values to their expected discrete factor values (where necessary), as is in the case with categorical factors. The Sobol' scheme is therefore disrupted due to the adjustment and so a Sobol' sensitivity analysis may exhibit comparatively poor convergence. Subsequent assessment of  uncertainty and sensitivity is instead conducted with the distribution-based  PAWN method (Pianosi and Wagener 2015, 2018).","category":"page"},{"location":"usage/scenario_generation/","page":"Generating scenarios","title":"Generating scenarios","text":"note: Sobol' samples\nThe convergence properties of the Sobol' sequence is only valid if the number of samples is a power of 2.","category":"page"},{"location":"usage/scenario_generation/","page":"Generating scenarios","title":"Generating scenarios","text":"Samples for factors with non-uniform distributions are transformed to their indicated distributions using the Inverse Cumulative Distribution Function method.","category":"page"},{"location":"usage/scenario_generation/","page":"Generating scenarios","title":"Generating scenarios","text":"Although the Sobol' method is the default, any sampler supported by the Surrogates.jl package may be used.

A key criticism by Puy et al. was that the PAWN method is sensitive to its tuning parameters and thus may produce biased results. The tuning parameters referred to are the number of samples (N) and the number of conditioning points - n in Puy et al., but denoted as S here.\n\nPuy et al., found that the ratio of N (number of samples) to S has to be sufficiently high (NS  80) to avoid biased results. Pianosi and Wagener point out this requirement is not particularly difficult to meet. Using the recommended value (S = 10), a sample of 1024 runs (small for purposes of Global Sensitivity Analysis) meets this requirement (102410 = 1024). Additionally, lower values of NS is more an indication of faulty experimental design moreso than any deficiency of the PAWN method.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"API/#ADRIA.sensitivity.rsa-Tuple{DataFrames.DataFrame, AbstractVector{<:Real}}","page":"ADRIA API","title":"ADRIA.sensitivity.rsa","text":"rsa(X::DataFrame, y::Vector{<:Real}; S=10)::NamedDimsArray\nrsa(rs::ResultSet, y::AbstractArray{<:Real}; S::Int64=10)::NamedDimsArray\n\nPerform Regional Sensitivity Analysis.\n\nRegional Sensitivity Analysis is a Monte Carlo Filtering approach which aims to identify which (group of) factors drive model outputs within or outside of a specified bound. Outputs which fall inside the bounds are regarded as \"behavioral\", whereas those outside are \"non-behavioral\". The distribution of behavioral/non-behavioral subsets are compared for each factor. If the subsets are not similar, then the factor is influential. The sensitivity index is simply the maximum distance between the two distributions, with larger values indicating greater sensitivity.\n\nThe implemented approach slices factor space into S bins and iteratively assesses behavioral (samples within the bin) and non-behavioral (out of bin samples) subsets with the non-parametric k-sample Anderson-Darling test. Larger values indicate greater dissimilarity (thus, sensitivity). The Anderson-Darling test places more weight on the tails compared to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\n\nRSA can indicate where in factor space model sensitivities may be, and contributes to a Value-of-Information (VoI) analysis.\n\nIncreasing the value of S increases the granularity of the analysis, but necessitates larger sample sizes.\n\nNote: Values of type missing indicate a lack of samples in the region.\n\nArguments\n\nrs : ResultSet\nX : scenario specification\ny : scenario outcomes\nS : number of bins to slice factor space into (default: 10)\n\nReturns\n\nNamedDimsArray, [bin values, factors]\n\nExamples\n\nADRIA.sensitivity.rsa(X, y; S=10)\n\nReferences\n\nPianosi, F., K.
