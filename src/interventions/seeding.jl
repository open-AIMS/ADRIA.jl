    distribute_seeded_corals(seed_loc_area::Vector{Float64}, available_space::Vector{Float64}, seeded_area::YAXArray)::YAXArray

Calculate proportion of deployed corals to be seeded at each of the selected locations.
Distributes seeded corals according to current available space at each selected site.

# Arguments
- seed_loc_k_m² : Carrying capacity area of locations to seed in m².
- available_space : Currently available space at each seed location in m².
- seeded_area : Area (in m²) of each coral type to be seeded with dim taxa.
- seed_volume : Absolute number of coral to deploy.

# Returns
- YAXArray[taxa to seed ⋅ number of seed locations], Proportional increase in cover relative to locations' `k` area
- Matrix[seed locations ⋅ taxa to seed], Number of coral deployed
