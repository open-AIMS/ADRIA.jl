    distribute_seeded_corals(seed_loc_area::Vector{Float64}, available_space::Vector{Float64}, seeded_area::YAXArray)::YAXArray

Calculate proportion of deployed corals to be seeded at each of the selected locations.
Distributes seeded corals according to current available space at each selected site.

# Arguments
- seed_loc_k_m² : carrying capacity area of locations to seed in m².
- available_space : currently available space at each seed location in m².
- seeded_area : area (in m²) of each coral type to be seeded with dim taxa.

# Returns
YAXArray[taxa to seed ⋅ number of seed locations], area increased relative to k area.

Deploy thermally enhanced corals to indicated locations ("seeding" or "outplanting").
Increases indicated area covered by the given coral taxa and determines the modified
distribution of critical DHW thresholds.

Note: Units for all areas are expected to be identical, and are assumed to be in m².

# Arguments
- `cover` : Area currently covered by coral
- `loc_k_area` : Carrying capacity of location (in m²)
- `leftover_space_m²` : Currently available area at each location
- `seed_locs` : Selected locations to seed
- `seeded_area` : Area to seed
- `seed_sc` : Indicates in-matrix locations of the coral size classes to seed
- `a_adapt` : Mean of thermal enhancement in terms of DHW
- `Yseed` : Log of seeded locations to update
- `c_dist_t` : Critical DHW distributions of corals to update (i.e., for time \$t\$)
